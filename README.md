## This repository is one where I am keeping my initial files from learning the SAS programming language.

### Files located in the repository
+ 1. Program 1-This is a basic program creating my own data and creating a table using proc print.
  2. Program 2-Creates data and does linear regression analysis on the data.
  3. SasPractice-This a variety of different SAS programming skills and techniques from creating new libraries to working with conditional statements to changing formats for data within a table.
  4. importpractice-This is practice importing data from an outside source and changing formats to fit SAS.
  5. libname and libname2-These are creating libraries with libname2 using options so data will work in SAS and using proc contents to describe the data.
  6. shoeprogrampractice-This program creates a new column (NetSales) from a data table and then finds the mean and sum of netsales by region.
  7. validatingpractice-This program uses proc print, proc means, proc univariate, and proc freq to help validate the data from a storm summary table.
  8. MacroPractice-This is a basic program giving an example of introducing macro variables so you only have to change the macro variable and not all the variables inside the program.
  9. Data_Manipulation_Practice-This is a practice activity where a new table is created from an existing table using a where and format statement.  The Geo column was dropped.
  10. gettingridofduplicates-This is a practice activity where we get rid of any duplicate rows of data in a table.
  11. list_of_cars2-This is a practice where I created a new variable that determines whether a car is "American Made" or not and then creates a list of cars that are American made and under $27,000.
  12. age_analysis-This is a age analysis I did where I was taking insurance data and breaking it into 5 year age groups and measuring the number of applications, net applications, premium and other measures that fall into these groups.
